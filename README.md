## Weather Dashboard

This project is a weather dashboard that fetches data from a public weather API and displays it to the user.

### How to Use

1. Open the `weather-dashboard.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter a location in the input field and click the "Search" button.
3. The weather data for the entered location will be displayed, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
4. If the API request fails or if the user inputs invalid data, an error message will be displayed.

### Chosen Weather API

The weather dashboard uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

### Obtaining an API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the "API keys" section in your account settings.
4. Generate a new API key and copy it.
5. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `weather-dashboard.js` file with your actual API key.
